## **Understanding Computer**

Computers always carry out operation following 4 task in a particular order. It first takes input, stores the information, processes the information and populates the output.  

**Input:** Computer takes input by pressing key on keyboard, clicking mouse, listening to sound, clicking button on webpages, etc. 

**Store:** Depending on the input computer transfers the input information or data to the memory location of the computer.

**Process:** Computer manipulates the information by using series of command or algorithm based on the given input instruction.

**Output:** Presents the result after processing the given information. Ex: information received after google search, video display on screen, calculator calculations, etc.

## **Binary System**
Computer processes any input in the forms of 1 and 0. Pictures, colors, sounds, letters, numbers and everything else is understood by the computer in the form of 1 and 0. Each number is transfered through one wire and carry a single bit of data. More number of wires means it can process larger data. 


## **Hardware and Software**

Hardware is something that you physically see it like circuits, chips, plugs, wires, speakers, etc. Software is code, program or instruction that you don't really see it but gives command to hardware to perform the action. Application, games, websites, etc. are software.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)
CPU is the masterchip that controls all the other parts of the computer. Depending on the inputs received, it separates the input and sends it to the respective processing unit. For example: when add command is received, CPU sends data to calculating ciruit or when store command is received, it sends data to memory circuit.
