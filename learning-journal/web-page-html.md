## Process and Design a website

### Who is the site for?

When creating a website, one should begin with asking series of questions on who is the traget audience for the website that is getting built. It is very important to know the target audience so that it meets audience expectation and provide the service the audience is looking for. Some questions that can be asked are:

#### Targeting individual 

- What is the age range of your target audience?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- Do they live in urban or rural areas?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- What level of education do they have?
- What is their marital or family status?

#### Targeting companies

- What is the size of the company or relevant department?
- What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- How large is the budget they control?

### Why would people visit your site?

- Are they looking for general
entertainment or do they
need to achieve a specific
goal?
- If there is a specific goal, is
it a personal or professional
one?
- Do they see spending time on
this activity?
- Are they already familiar the offered products and services?

### How often people will visit your site?
- How often do the same
people return to purchase
from you?

## Site Map

## Wireframes

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. This way a developer can ensures that the topics that needs to go in the particular page is included.
