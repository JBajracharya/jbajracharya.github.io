## Version Control

Version control is a system that records the changes on the file everytime it is changed and allows to revisit every changed files as 
necessary. With this ability, it allows one to change back to any of the previous version file, track modifications, modifiy individual 
version and compare the changes between different version. 

Version control evolved from local version control in which the changes to files are store in one database on the local hard disk, to 
centralized version control in which file versions are stored in single server and accessed by various clients through that server and 
now to a distributed version control(DVCS) which solved the issues with previous version control systems. DVCS allows client to create 
mirror repository which creates a backup and these backup can be placed on the server to replace any lost information. Since it allows
multiple mirrored repository, it increases the flexibility in colloboration and various simultaneous workflows. 

## What is git?

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. When a file is changed and saved, it creates a snapshot of the file
and stores a reference to it. It fetches the history information from the local hard disk, eliminating the need to fetch the information 
from the server. Git tracks every changes in the files and detects any file corruption or loss information in transit. So, it greatly 
minimizes the risk of losing any data.
