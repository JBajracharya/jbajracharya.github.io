## Having a Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is having a mindset of continuous learning, improving and developing despite any adversaries that come along the way. 
Having a growth mindset, one stays focused on their objective and not distracted by any challenges and obstacles that come through their 
way. They accept the challenges and obstacles and work their way through perseverance and patience.

## My three mantras to stay on growth mindset
- When faced by obstacle, do not get frustrated and avoid the task. Take a step back, analyse the situation carefully step by step and stay
  focused. Always remember that you learn from dealing with obstacles and it contributes to improving your abilities in the future.
- Assess your day on how it went. Think about what went right and what went wrong and what could you have done to improve the things that 
  went wrong.
- "No pain, no gain", remember this motivational phrase. To achieve the goal, you have to keep working on it even when it is exteremely 
   difficult and challenging.
