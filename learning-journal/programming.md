## **Interactive web page**

Javascript makes web page interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser. It makes the web page interactive by responding to what the user does.

**Access Content:** You can select any element, attribute or text from a HTML page. For example: selecting all the text inside the <p> element, selecting element that have id attribute with value note or find out what is entered in the particular element.

**Modify Content:** Javascript can add or delete any elements, attributes or text on a html page. Ex: adding `<h1>` element and paragraph of text inside the element, changing the size or position of an `<img>` element.

**Program rules** You can set the steps the browsers to follow and display or change the content of the page. Ex: allowing players to move to next level in the game only after completing the challenge.

**React to events:** You can specify the script to run when the specific event is occurred. Ex: pressing a button opens up a new page or hovering the mouse enlarge the image.

## **Expressions**
An expression evaluates into a single value. Expression uses different operators like `+, -, *, /` to create a single value from one or more values. There are two types of expression.

1. **Expression that just assigns a value to a variable.**

    `var name = 'John';`

2. **Expression that use two or more values and return a single value.**

    ```
    addition operator
        var sum = 5 + 10;
        value is 15

    comparison operators
        age = 4 > 6;
        value is false;

    string operator
        greeting 'Hi' + 'John';
        combines two strings

    logical operator
        call = (4 > 6) || (5 < 10);
        value is true
     ```
