### Having a Growth Mindset

*A growth mindset is having a mindset of continuous learning, improving and developing despite any
adversaries that come along the way. Having a growth mindset, one stays focused on their objective 
and not distracted by any challenges and obstacles that come through their way. They accept the 
challenges and obstacles and work their way through perseverance and patience.*


### My three mantras to stay on growth mindset

- *When faced by obstacle, do not get frustrated and avoid the task. Take a step back, analyse 
the situation carefully step by step and stay focused. Always remember that you learn from dealing
with obstacles and it contributes to improving your abilities in the future.*  
- *Assess your day on how it went. Think about what went right and what went wrong and what could
you have done to improve the things that went wrong.*
- *`"No pain, no gain"`, remember this motivational phrase. To achieve the goal, you have to keep 
working on it even when it is exteremely difficult and challenging.*
