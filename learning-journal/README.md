## Brief Introduction:

Hello, my name is Jitendra Bajracharya. I'm a military veteran, served 6 and a half years in active duty army as logistics specialist and language interpreter translating in two different languages Nepalese and Hindi. Having a great interest in programming, I started taking programming classes while I was in service. I went to Microsoft Software and System Academy bootcamp and graduated in Cloud Application Development as part of my transitioning. Currently I have been learning full stack web development on my own through Udemy online courses and various other online resources. I greatly enjoy coding. I'm very excited to start the career in this field and looking forward to a great training at code fellows.
